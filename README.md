# PRO README Maker [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]

  ## Description

  The PRO README Maker is a command line-run application aimed at developers. It uses a series of command line prompts to ultimately allow a developer to create a professional README. This application will ask questions regarding a project's name and other information regarding the project to be used in the Description, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions sections of a professional README. By properly answering all command line prompt questions, this README will include a table of contents with functional links to the proper sections, a license badge, and (in the Question section specifically) information on how to contact the developer. This section will include a functional link to the developer's GitHub account.By completing this project, I gained a better understanding of the Node.js environment and its difference from a window browser environment, as well as exporting/importing js modules and specifically using the inquirer package.

  Upon running the program, a developer's terminal should look like the following screenshot: [!Screenshot of Sample Generator](./screenshots//generator.png)

  ## Installation

  To install this application, a developer must clone this repo, and on the command line install all dependencies (npm i). To initialize this application, one must enter node index.js in the command line.

  ## Usage 

  To make full use of PRO README Maker, a developer should answer all questions, as if they were writing on the README.md itself. If a developer wishes to include hyperlinks or images, use the same syntax as if they were writing on README.md.This application only guides a developer to create a professional README. A developer is free to edit the README.md itself after using PRO README Maker. However, if a developer would like to completely start over, initializing PRO README Maker will overwrite everything. [This video](https://youtu.be/CgVkRK_wPb8) is a complete walkthrough of how to use PRO README Maker, using this README as an example.
